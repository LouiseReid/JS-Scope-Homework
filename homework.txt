// Episode 1

var name = 'Keith';

var printName = function() {
  console.log('My name is ' + name );
};

printName();

// Will print "My name is Keith" as Keith is assigned to name


// Episode 2

score = 5;

var result = function() {
  var score = 3;
  return score;
};

console.log(result());

// Will return 3 as the variable score has been changed within the function

// Episode 3

var myAnimals = ['Chickens', 'Cats', 'Rabbits'];

var listAnimals = function() {
  myAnimals = ['Ducks', 'Dogs', 'Lions'];
  for(var i=0;i<myAnimals.length; i++){
    console.log(i + ": " + myAnimals[i]);
  }
}

listAnimals();

//Will return 0: Ducks 1:Dogs 2:Lions as the variable myAnimals is changed within
//the function.  Its looping through, printing i as a number then the animal.

// Episode 4

var suspectOne = 'Jay';
var suspectTwo = 'Val';
var suspectThree = 'Keith';
var suspectFour = 'Rick';

var allSuspects = function() {
  var suspectThree = 'Harvey'
  console.log('Suspects include: ' + suspectOne + ', ' + suspectTwo + ', ' + suspectThree + ', ' + suspectFour)
};

allSuspects();
console.log( 'Suspect three is:' + suspectThree );

//Will print "Suspects include Jay, Val, Harvey, Rick" as suspect3 is reasigned to
//Harvey in the function.
//"Suspect3 is Keith" as it can't see in the function so goes up to the top level
//where it can see it.

// Episode 5

var detective = {
  name : 'Ace Ventura',
  pet : 'monkey'
};

var printName = function(detective) {
  return detective.name
};

var detectiveInfo = function() {
  detective['name'] = 'Poirot'
  return printName(detective);
};

console.log(detectiveInfo())

//Will return Poirot as in detectiveInfo the name is reasigned.  Its then
//calling on the printName function wich returns the objects name value.

// Episode 6

var murderer = 'rick';

var outerFunction = function() {
  var murderer = 'marc';

  var innerFunction = function() {
    murderer = 'valerie';
  }

  innerFunction();
}

outerFunction();
console.log('the murderer is ', murderer);

//Will return "the murderer is rick" as the log is being called outwith the
//function so can't see any of the reasignments happening within the function.
